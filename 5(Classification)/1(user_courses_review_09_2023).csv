"AI Applications for Business Success","Quantile Difference Tests",3,"This is my first advanced specialisation course and I really appreciate the thorough advanced statistics provided. That being said the lecturer must be nearer to the mic when doing his recordings as well as be a bit more enthusiastic ( I dont know how but data science should be taught more thought provoking or a subtle change of tone from time to time as opposed to the monotone voice ive heard throughout all these lectures). The code is outdated in the git hub and the preliminary stages of running those codes in Github did not work. Lecture notes would useful as I am patient enough to use the subtitles and pick out what I assume (I am guessing) is the most important statistical knowledge from the course. The courses before had pdf files to explain statistics and they are very helpful for data science students globally."
"AI Applications for Business Success","Correlation vs. Causation",3,"I would love to translate the subtitle to Dutch or at least have subtitles in english, then I can speed up, the video, because the voice over is really boring to listen to and it causes me, that I switch over to other websites. The topic about the swot analysis and smart goals is great but what has it really to do with data science. The best way to find a business case is to understand the core processes, so i guess that is the goal? "

"Data Analysis with Excel Pivot Tables","This is how the report can be used in practice by high-level executives",4,"Well, it's a great course and I learned something new. But I'll prefer if the practical aspect and dataset used would be one that everyone can relate to - whether an economist or not or an accountant or not. I didn't relate well with the practical aspect because I didn't understand those net sales and so on. That wasn't my scope of study in school so I didn't really get along well (or maybe the course can be renamed to "Data Analysis with Pivot Tables For Financial Analysts", lol). 
But all the same, thanks so much to the instructor. You did a great job. God bless."

These courses don't suit my learning style.  It isn't at all clear how these courses work in general. Having to download multiple Excel spreadsheets to practice each task is insane, not to mention that I have to go back to watch the video multiple times to execute the task. The timed practice exams are frustrating- a newcomer can't execute the task and answer questions in the time allotted.  I would not pay to have access to these courses.  "

"Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with pandas","A Few Comments on Using .loc[] and .iloc[]",4,"It was great in giving me an overview in how pandas work , though the course title was a bit misleading , since we didn't get to "clean" any data , for example use .fillna() and such"
"Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with pandas","A Few Comments on Using .loc[] and .iloc[]",4,"I'd expect a more practical approach to the topic, usage of pandas library. The structure of the course feels weird. Second chapter that has only 5 min feels like it's missing the rest 55m. I recon everyone gets the same feeling after coming here from numpy course."
"Data Cleaning and Preprocessing with pandas","A Few Comments on Using .loc[] and .iloc[]",4,"Excellent course for what it is, but I was under the impression that I'll learn how to clean the data, such as dealing with NaN values and such.

It felt like someone reading out keyword-definition phrases(had to rewind a lot). the course is oriented on the basic usage of pandas for a career but the questions in practice exams are tricky and high-order-thinking like nowhere was it mentioned explicitly in the course that dfs can be made only by a list of lists"

The course is mainly about some basic concept of pandas, but non of them are related to data cleaning even preprocessing. 
Hope we have more lessons about those topic and some real world projects like we did in "Data Preprocessing with NumPy".

"Data Literacy","The ETL Process",5,"My learning journey is awesome, this course broadens my spectrum. "
"Data Literacy","Reading Data",5,"Yh, your courses are explicitly great such hard work is being put in here. I tremendously appreciate them. But as a level 4 course reader now I have some recommendations that could better ease our understanding of the course materials.
1. I understand that animation presentations of lectures are a faster way and quite a good teaching method.. but when I did the Python Bootcamp it was quite better because I felt like someone was talking to me. Hence, I will appreciate it if the tutors showcase themselves as we move through the courses.
2. Although we have practical examples I will love if real-life projects and videos of how workers in the company discuss and solve them, they should be shown or even as a data major intern goes to work and his job descriptions at the office this help us to prepare for the working environment. More projects and problems faced by companies in each course. Thanks.
3. Take us out of the learning environment sometimes surveying companies and showing us how the data is collected.

your slids are very nice. How can I prepare the slides so beautifully?"
"Data Literacy","The ETL Process",4,"Can we have short quiz after each video?
"

"Data Literacy","The ETL Process",4,
"Data Literacy","Recall and Precision",3,"The resources could have been more elaborative containing the minute/subparts of the content, especially for the statistical terms, i.e. its tough to keep the statistical terminologies intact in the head without lecture notes."
"Data Literacy","The ETL Process",3,"I feel he's glossing over things that are important to the ethics of data, i.e. suggesting that veracity isn't important to bid data or only briefly mentioning the job of verifying and validating data.

Ethics in data is really important, and it needs to be taught to all individuals pursuing any career that uses data."
"Data Literacy","The ETL Process",3,"Data types like Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio should have better elaboration and examples. There should be relevant tests/questions interspersed between modules so that the student feels confident that s/he is able to understand correctly "
"Data Literacy","Recall and Precision",3,"quiz questions are missing. too many theory, it should be  accompanied by additional tasks"
"Data Literacy","The ETL Process",3,"Should have more frequent quizzes and help users solidify their knowledge like the course Introduction to Data and Data Science."
"Data Literacy","Recall and Precision",3,"I don't feel confident that the data terms and concepts in the course are sufficient to perform in a modern business setting."
"Data Literacy","The ETL Process",3,"Not enough challenges and real-life applications, some modules had fried vocals which made it hard to listen to."
"Data Literacy","Reading Data",3,"Too hard for beginners because the lectures are more like theory based and technical jargons rather than simple explanations with real world examples, the examples given are only overviews"
"Data Literacy","Reading Data",3,"I think the course needs to be more practical even if there's an Excel sheet shared on the resources but we didn't apply it through the course "
"Data Literacy","Recall and Precision",3,"I found the first modules easier to follow. The last part was quite heavy for someone who is quite new to this field."

"Data Preprocessing with NumPy","Completing the Dataset:",5,"This last section with the practical example is the cherry of the cake. It helps widen the conceptualization taught in the course, beyond common grounds. People have different way of learning and the more approach you offer, the better. 
I have had a short journey in Data Science, yet it is evident that practice plays a huge part on it. Such activity takes you from 0 to 100 and greatly increases your confidence in the subject.
Food for thought: I don't know how plausible it is, but if the same could be applied for the career track courses, where we could have all subjects wrapped up into a big work, that would be exceptional."

"Data Preprocessing with NumPy",np.savetxt(),3,"Overall the course is good for beginners. Problems could be of different types. Random generator section has achieved the prize of worst section of the entire course. I barely could understand the section. The instructor just uses poisson, logistics etc. distributions and said we should have statistical knowledge for this. But he could just explain the trials, events, occurrences etc. to us rather than just showing some code. "

"Data Strategy","Curating the most important data insights",5,"Course is great, but some more features to the website would make the learning easier like, the video title at the start of the video (not all videos come with the titles at the start), only the audio version of the videos, especially to repeat any video on the drive to work or for passive learning for a brush up and of course an easy to use mobile friendly app."

"Data Strategy","Curating the most important data insights",5,"This course has to be the most interesting course I have come across thus far on the 365DataScience.com platform. This is all to the credit of Bernard Marr - unlike the other lecturers he opened his course material by showing his face and having an open ended introduction of himself as well as giving insight on his experience. He further more elaborates on the books he has written, which I myself made it a point to purchase for further reading. I find Bernard Marr to be very informed in his subject matter and is an excellent lecturer as he uses many interesting examples which better explain his course material. Keep up the good work Bernard, keep the benchmark dangling high!  "

"Data Strategy","Curating the most important data insights",3,"The concepts covered are very good.

"Data Strategy","Using data for good",3,"Too many unnecessary words were used in the course of explaining something simple which makes it less engaging. Typical business lingo."
"Data Strategy","Using data for good",3,"It's a very informative, fantastic course but it placed terribly in this module. My advice would be to either place it later in the module or in some later module or maybe break down this 5-hour course into 2-3 parts. I think the content dealt with here concerns more or less with an experienced/managerial level. Without prior knowledge of technical tools, it seems too vague to implement/picture it happening. It felt more like visiting the theoretical basics of data science lecture at a traditional college where the professor bombarded me with all the Info/steps required to be highly successful in the field. Also, it could have been more interesting and insightful if the explanations involved examples of real-life business cases and solutions with the help of the technical tools already learned from the last courses rather than just the definitions making it more doable."

"Data Strategy","Curating the most important data insights",2,"The lectures are poorly organized and confusing."
"Data Strategy","Curating the most important data insights",2,"The course was fine but the exam needs improving. There was a lot of text to read and get through and not a lot of time (about one minute per question). As a slow reader, I felt at a real disadvantage. It must be really hard for those who don't have English as a first language."

"Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2","Non-NN approaches",5,"The course exceeded my expectations and provided a structured approach to develop NN's in Tensorflow. I established the individual concepts followed by connecting the dots(big picture) and thereby giving the learners with a process as a result. A big thumbs up to the team. The one thing I personally felt is that it came off a very math lite. If another course solely dedicated to the Mathematics behind these algorithms could be developed then we could have it as a powerful weapon in our arsenal."

"Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2","Early stopping - motivation and types",2,"This course is all theory, almost no TensorFlow. There is a point to learning theory, but the name of this course is severely misleading."
"Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2","Non-NN approaches",2,"Theory was fundamental to understanding the course. The instructor went into a good enough detail with the theory. The issue with that approach is the "robotic voiceover." Hearing too much of the robotic voice made the process of completing the theory daunting. I recommend the theoretical be explained with a normal voice over."
"Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2","Non-NN approaches",1,"The teacher teaching style is like a TV news caster, continuously reading with a single tone, seems like he is in hurry to quickly finish. Sorry for my comments, but that's what I observe it. Anyhow contents are good."

Lastly, it would be great if there would be more notes in the resources."

"Git and GitHub",Conclusion,4,"I would have liked to learn more about forking repos and a bit more about integration of Git with CI/CD tools. Even though git pull and fetch are recommended for self-study, it would still be good to cover these even briefly.
Would be also helpful to know what files should not be stored on Git (e.g., data etc)."
"Git and GitHub",Branching,4,"Very Good, but it is about very very basics so do not make high expectations that you will learn a lot of things, but finally, I really recommend it as a good beginning. "
"Git and GitHub",Branching,4,"Good... Good explaination"

"Git and GitHub",Branching,4,"A bit basic, but incredibly well explained. It would be amazing if there's a part 2 and 3 for more advance use cases."
"Git and GitHub",Conclusion,4,"This overview was quite fast. You cover a topic in a couple of minutes, so it can be tricky to catch idea immediately."
"Git and GitHub",Branching,4,"It's really useful but it needs some more commands or how to act in different situations for Example: "when I merge branches sometimes it asks me to make a commit massage and for beginner how should I know, I must press : then wq or something""

"Git and GitHub",Branching,3,Good
"Git and GitHub",Conclusion,3,"needs to be updated a bit. got lost on adding the text file in the beginning so more clarification on that would be appreciated"
"Git and GitHub",Conclusion,3,"I was expecting a few more things, but whatver they covered was done nicely."
"Git and GitHub",Conclusion,3,"Good coverage of basics, but would have liked more info about other IDEs like Atom, Vim, Nano, VS Code"
"Git and GitHub",Conclusion,3,"It would be great to have a more comprehensive course on Git/Github."
"Git and GitHub",Conclusion,2,"For beginners, it is very difficult to understand everything. I think it would have been better if everything was explained in detail."
"Git and GitHub",Branching,2,"For non-IT backgrounds, it is complicated to keep up with this pace. Other videos are made with illustrations in them, so I expect there are some illustrations to make this course easy to digest. I also think there is more about Git and GitHub topics to learn "

There are 2 main topics missing that were called out in section 1 and the speaker even says at the end "see you in the next lesson"
That's the first course I am truly disappointed.
The content is good, and it would be a 4-star rating if it would be complete. 
2 stars, because the insights are good, but I don't like the presenting style. There are visually better videos on this platform

"Intermediate Python Programming","Working with Python Strings at the Next Level",3,"I really enjoyed the piece on lambda functions, it was very well structured but the rest of the course was very heavy on string formatting. I feel like the content should have been a "beyond the Python Bootcamp". Again, the lambda function lectures were great but I expected at least one more difficult topic to be included. The strings section could have been its own 30-45 minute course since the difficulty is not high, its just a lot of variation and syntax practice."
"Intermediate Python Programming","Working with Anonymous (Lambda) Functions",3,Incomplete
"Intermediate Python Programming","Working with Anonymous (Lambda) Functions",2,"In my opinion, the course is not below average, but it has room for improvement. I believe that the course content could be more comprehensive and provide more in-depth coverage of intermediate Python concepts. Additionally, I think that the course could be enhanced by incorporating some of its content into the Python Programmer Bootcamp course, rather than having two separate courses. "

"Intro to ChatGPT and Generative AI","Why you and your company must embrace AI",4,Awesome
"Intro to ChatGPT and Generative AI","Why you and your company must embrace AI",4,"The course thoroughly broke down ChatGPT and it's impressive capabilities in a way that can be widely understood and implemented into a variety of different fields. What stuck out most was the emphasis on being thorough with your inputs into ChatGPT while also reviewing the output for any errors or points needing clarification / elaboration.

My only critique is to add a few hands-on activities so that students have some time interacting with ChatGPT while actively taking the course (albeit the course does provide a great template to use as people continue to work with the tool on their own)."

"Intro to ChatGPT and Generative AI","Why you and your company must embrace AI",2,"The lack of understanding of potential future consequences is staggering. Tremendous responsibility is carried with the use of generative AI which this course briefly gleams over in favor of promoting technology that is inherently flawed. The escalated use of such technologies will only widen the gaping maw of problems at hand. Otherwise the course provides sufficient background aside from a lack of mechanical knowledge. It's concerning to focus on prompt engineering versus how ChatGPT understands your prompt at a data level."

"Introduction to Business Analytics","Practical case study (part 2)",4,"Great course overall, really liked the applicative nature. Just taking off one start because some of the sections (especially parts of section 5) did only touch upon complex (statistical) topics (see the acceptable value range for R coefficient) without explanations, or assuming a solid background knowledge. Also, a few of the topics, especially towards the end, felt a little repetitive, even overlapping. All in all however, excellent course, providing a very useful comprehensive overview of BIA, with a well structured presentation able to bring together a wide array of processes in a clear manner. Well done. "

"Introduction to Business Analytics","Practical case study (part 2)",3,"1. Add more practice. As a person, who learns by doing things (I have bad perception by listening or watching) it is crucial for me to have more practice. Otherwise, I would have to do some practice on my own, which would cost me extra time and money. I suppose, now I need to find some simulator on analyzing company's data and make my own conclusions.
2. Try to widen the range of examples: online services, medical centers, recreational institutions etc.
3. I want double mouse click to expand video. And I want space to pause/play the video. Just as on youtube. Now Space triggers the last clicked button on the videoplayer. So, sometimes I click Space and video simply quits fullscreen.
4. I want the autoplay function to play videos right away and open them in full screen (or in the same view, as the previous one was). Now, after the previous video is finished, I get simply redirected to the next one, which does not start.
5. I want the "Next" button somewhere in the video player, so I could proceed to the following video without waiting for the current one to end. Searching in the right panel is not convenient."

"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",4,"I liked the videos.
They kept me engaged throughout the short course, providing bite-sized notes aided by images of the application of the different technical concepts.

The explanation is very good, simple choice of words, with clarification of technical terms, covering differences and similarities between the various concepts.
As accustomed as I am to hard paper studying, I tend to do a lot of transcription and paraphrases to present differences and similarities between concepts myself.
In these Videos, they highlight the keywords and link them for you.

On the other hand, Some flaws I identified are in the degree of the explanation. They were conveyed quite swiftly, and a bit shallowly I would say, yet as it is mentioned in the title (Introduction), you shouldn't expect in-depth coverage of the concept, but just a presentation of the key ideas and terminology you will encounter in the full career path.

Hence, For the points that I have stated, I think is already a good incipit, thus I wouldn't put it down as much, and although it may seem tedious from an outside view, I can assure you it's worth all of its time.
I recommend it !!! "

I have a feeling, that I would need more quiz questions to really solidify the new knowledge - for example  I can repeat the examples about qualitative and quantitative analysis from part one, but I'm  not really sure I got the principle right.

It's really good that the course points out several times, that in many places these terms are being used differently - they really were in my previous company and it pops out in random places... I'm happy to be show other perspective."

"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",4,"I really like the course, but maybe it is just the choppy audio (the voice is fine just the sudden start and start) or maybe it is just me and I am not in learning mood as (I am kinda tired) I am a little bored. Though, this is the introductory course so it isn‚Äôt to the interactive part of it yet, so that might be a thing which is fine. Without a foundation, how can you build a multistory house? I say 4 stars for several reasons. Not because of the course, though. Here is one example: Some people will not look at 5 stars and because of possible bias (and kinda the same with 1 stars) they will look at 2-4 star reviews first. (I am not saying this is a majority, just some). The course‚Äôs info-graph itself is going to be extremely helpful for remembering the terms, that doesn‚Äôt include the breakdown of the info graph and other information in the course."

- : the explanation is based on the flow of the data. the table brings several dimensions to this flow. all dimensions are not as important. it  would be clearer with a graph with data associated to it than with a table: there is a lot of type of relations that are not very specific and fit in a table, and that are a lot clearer with another presentation.  maybe it's a question of taste.

"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",4,"As far as being a basic overview of the terms that are going to be used later on It's pretty decent. It's just an introduction class and does a fine job of introducing the topic. My personal opinion is those people in the comments above who are complaining about it being confusing and Whatnot aren't taking the time to effectively study or take notes, and they're expecting to just absorb everything like a sponge. You do have to interact with it somewhat. I guess what I'm saying is you're going to get what you put in."

"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",4,"The narrator is very clear and his explanations are good. The accompanying infographic and learning materials are easy to understand. My only criticism would be to ask more questions of the learner to ensure they fully understand the concepts."
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",4,"very explanatory and easy to understand. quite interesting"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",4,"I really enjoyed it, super interesting to start with. I would say that the questions need to be reviewed as a couple did not match the topic seen in the previous video (still you can try to answer).

"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",4,"Nice introduction. Touched everything I needed to know on data related jobs requirements and overall data "
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",3,"Every concept was too broad or generalized. I expected more content in introductory course compared to other intro to data science course in other platforms. For challenges, I expected it to be a bit more profound or challenging."
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"Feels like a lot of memorization "
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"difficult to memorize and not exactly the most engaging"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",3,"I thought it was quite boring overall. It's nothing against the person making it."
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"The course really has difficult definitions to understand"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",3,"Much of the information seemed overwhelming and not important at the same time. 

Personally, I felt the semantics of the definitions (data scientist vs data analyst) to be very boring and not particularly useful, and therefore could not remember the difference between the terms. 

The structure I like. The videos and explanations were clear. I enjoyed the course more when it went more into the graphs and process of machine learning. 

The questions just had to do mainly with memorization. The brief videos were not enough to engrain the terms and subtle differences into my memory. 

I failed almost all the quizzes the first time and had to retake them to get a passing grade. 

Maybe an aniki flashcard setup to prep for the quizzes would be a solution to get the buzzwords to stick in memory. 

I think I'll like the rest of the course better when the topics are more interesting and get more into specifics. "
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"It's ok so far. Nothing new. All these things were already discussed in Udemy's 365 data science bootcamp. Hope to see new content as we move forward."

"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"No bad"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"well structured ...I think this video must be made long back and doesnot cover latest advancments happening in data science field .. such as deep learning"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"I wanted hands on experience, this was just an ok course"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"Awesome. "
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",3,"The course is clear, but a little bit repetitive. I do LOVE the infographic, but the explanation is not being done in a logical manner (jumping from left to right and right to left again)."
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",2,"Average. Not Explained with practical examples just only therory "
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",2,"these video animations are so unengaging. the voice overs are making my ears bleed. Can you imagine your first day of college and your professor spoke like one of these people? It's so patronizing. "
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",2,"The quiz questions are not very clear, a lot of them are vague, poorly worded or controversial, multiple answers could be true, or the answers were not clearly covered in the course."
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",2,"The titles of the chapters would be great that way we have an idea how many we finished and how many more to go"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",2,"Delving into terminology first is the most boring way to start teaching/learning any discipline.  You should think about a task where participants do rather than just talked to about "buzzwords".

As a teacher myself, I hope that your future modules are more engaging and instructional."
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",2,"Some courses are great n shi ngl, but tbh some videos are just fillings to the course that could be summed up in an essay or smth"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",2,"well am still enjoying the lecture "
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",2,"The lecture via generic animation that ressembles those on Study.com are soporific. The information is not uninteresting but the voice of the narrator isn‚Äôt engaging. It‚Äôs very scripted and the template at the start of each video only shows guys which seems dated. 
"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",1,"I got the impression that this course is made for the purpose of memorizing the concepts rather than actually understanding them. The infographs are very confusing and making a big deal out of things that aren't meant to be that complicated. That data vs data science vs ML vs Ai vs BI things weren't supposed to be at the start for someone who have zero experience and wants to simply learn about data and how to analyze it."
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Why do we Need each of these Disciplines?",1,"lock options is not user friendly at all
"
"Introduction to Data and Data Science","Dispelling Common Misconceptions",1,"Horrible quizzes with unclear questions; often asking about things that won't be taught until the next lesson. They do very little to help learners remember the content and often make things more confusing. Easily the worst introduction to data analytics/science I've ever seen. The one saving grace is the infographic, which is somewhat handy."

I would only add that, as a recorded class, having a script for the recording makes it for a better experience for the students, regarding the objectivity of the subject. I found it a little annoying, the repetitive "ok's" in some classes. It becomes harder not to notice it when you need to forward and backward the video to get points I missed.

Overall is great! I only can't make it 5 stars because I can'"

"Introduction to DAX","Calculation Groups",4,"most of the things are same as in powerBi course"
"Introduction to DAX","Calculation Groups",4,"I give 4 stars as, if you remove all the clutters, it is a course geared towards experienced users. The name with "introduction" is quite misleading. Other than this, good content and a lot I took away (again, best enjoyed if one is not new to DAX!)"

"Introduction to Excel","Bridge Chart",3,"As a total beginner in this field, I feel like I couldn't follow entirely with all the terms. I recommend adding to course information which courses are recommended to follow before this one. Furthermore, the location of the exam within the course should be changed, as already suggested in the comments. Lastly, I wasn't fan of how the videos had various styles instead of sticking to one style, and the last video also repeats information that was taught in an earlier video. It would be good to pay attention to this sort of things when making changes to courses. Overall, I did learn a lot of new things in Excel. I could follow it relatively well considering I have no background in this field."

"Introduction to R Programming",R-Squared,4,"This was an introductory course to data analysis with R, and it delivered what was expected from it. I am a senior programmer who is pro in python and ML in general, and I took this course to learn some basics I need for my university. The first 9 sections were not very useful for me, but a new learner defenitely need them. I hope we see some course with focus on more advanced topics, for example how would R scale to bigger ML or eve DL problems and why it is still used in industry, while Python is more widely acclaimed. is it just because Python is hard for non-cs people, and if so, would it be a good choice for someone who already knows python?"
"Introduction to R Programming",R-Squared,4,"It's a great introductory course. The instructor is wonderful. She tried to explain things as easy as possible. But there should be more real life examples and more problems. It would be great if an interactive coding platform could be introduced. However, I liked the course. She is damn good. Thank you for this wonderful journey. "

"Introduction to R Programming",R-Squared,3,"Pros:
Good introductory course.
The graphics are excellent.

Cons: Sections 7, 8, and 10 are poorly instructed in any way. Please slow down! Codes are not described in a logical manner. Simply copying and pasting will not get you anywhere.

It's difficult to type while listening to the instructor. The codes¬†are not available in R Script. Nothing is provided.¬† There are just exercises available. You must type everything from scratch, sometimes several times in one video.
You must type everything from scratch, sometimes several times in one video.
Quite often, the exercise instruction refers to another exercise that is time consuming and difficult to locate.

There are no course slides to which you can refer if necessary. To locate what you're looking for, you must watch the complete section."

Nevertheless, I have some mentions: 

- even if the trainer seems to be a pro in this field, his pace was a little too fast for total beginners;
- the videos should be retaken, as it was used a previous version of Tableau and there have been some (interface) modifications since then;
- the "Next Video" button at the end of each video doesn't work."

"Machine Learning in Python","Heatmaps using Seaborn",4,"This course did not made me feel confident as others and a bit fast but very understandable. Must have more concentration and write down things to understand the concept that is been tought. I gave it a 4 star because I was expecting it to be very intresting but was little hard to understand since still a above beginner in python and I got many errors and using CHATGPT I could eleminate those errors. I would like to go in depth after finishing the entire DataScience course. "
"Machine Learning in Python","Heatmaps using Seaborn",3,"Being able to code along is an important part of knowledge retention. The information was being given way too fast and forced me to pause multiple times to be able to code along. The resources that have the finalized versions are, imo, not a sufficient replacement in terms of learning value.

Moreover I believe a variety of concepts could have been broken down more to increase understanding; it seems like a lot of assumptions were made about what the user would know, and I often found myself a bit lost even having taken all the other courses of the Data Science career path in order."
"Machine Learning in Python","Making predictions with the linear regression",3,"Kindly Explain the concept briefly"
"Machine Learning in Python","Making predictions with the linear regression",3,"Several things could be explained more in depth, like the meaning of many pieces of code. It's not very clear."
"Machine Learning in Python","Heatmaps using Seaborn",3,"There are 2 repetitive videos about overfitting in different sections. Also in the last lecture, the lecturer said ' But this topic for a next section' but there is no next section. The same was for scalers. The lecturer said smth like this "We will show how to scale different features separately", but never showed. And I expected something deeper and also with some practical homework/exercises which can be automatically checked. Like "Write code to show scatter plot of "Salaries" csv file". It is not bad, quite interesting but too way kinda shallow. "

"Power BI","First Data Model",5,Good
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",5,"excellent resources"
"Power BI","First Data Model",5,Excellent
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",4,"expecting more real time cases rather than examples"
"Power BI",Workspaces,4,"It is quite extensive and great step by step exercises.  The only down side is that it uses an older version of Power BI so it makes difficult to relate to newer version as menus have changed quite a bit."
"Power BI",Workspaces,4,"Good approcah, but some content seems to be shown in wrong order. "
"Power BI","First Data Model",4,"Step by Step team i appreciate the tour"
"Power BI","First Data Model",4,"Will like to have more detailed examples and explanations"
"Power BI",Workspaces,4,
"Power BI",Workspaces,4,Good
"Power BI","First Data Model",4,"Really Good! You guys are GREAT!"
"Power BI","First Data Model",4,"A wonderful and interractive lessons hands-on."
"Power BI","First Data Model",3,"I thought it was going to be explained deeper"
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",3,"The information given is good, but I miss some slides among the resources, like in the SQL module. This would be helpful when we have some free time but with no computer to access the course."
"Power BI","First Data Model",3,Great
"Power BI",Workspaces,3,"Due to new update of Power BI, only 40% of course is accurate. It is harder to folow the videos as some tabs and functions do not match. "
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",3,"topics are explained in complicated way.i also feel videos are not in order.complicated parts are explained earlier then introduction parts are explained later.resources are missing at some videos,which makes learning boring when you are unable to practice along with video. At times i feel choice of words in certain situation brings barrier between explaination and understanding."
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",3,"You need beginner previous knowledge. The course seems a little disordered and messy. I could review and learn some things with a different approach than the previous class I took. Overall for me, it is ok, but a little tricky.
I suggest adding easy tasks between every video and reordering."
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",3,GOOD
"Power BI","First Data Model",3,"could do a better job of describing cardinality and relationships between tables. Primary key/foreign key concepts that are used in sql. 
"
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",3,"I'm a little bit skeptical that Task Four could be completed with the learning materials so far. 
Seems to me that a few aspects was skipped (e.g. creating a var)
With some googling I was able to catch up, but I think the content could be extended for newbies to PowerBI (or mention a prerequisite for this Course)"
"Power BI","First Data Model",3,"too basic "
"Power BI","First Data Model",3,"Connection over Microsoft Remote Desktop is so slow. As a Mac user, there is no chance to try all those steps. "
"Power BI",Workspaces,3,"The course feels a little outdated. Also, some sections have been moved around without considering the impact on references in the actual videos, which is confusing. 
In terms of the lessons themselves, I appreciated the hands-on approach, however I feel that too much time was spent on explaining basic features of the interface (text and color edits for example), while not enough time was dedicated to a more comprehensive explanation of often complex concepts relating to the DAX formulas. More background informarmation on why these work the way they do would have been veluable for learning. In fact, i found myself resorting to additional online resoufrces quite often in sections 2 to 6, so that I could properly grasp the formulas explained there. "
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",3,"It is a very advance course.... You skipped many basic things.... "
"Power BI",Workspaces,3,"I feel content was not correctly structured.  Sometimes teacher made reference to some files which were not available"
"Power BI","First Data Model",3,"So far ok. Things could be better explained. I missed  really basic stuff like an overview about the interface. Also, there is no need to mention something you're gonna explain later (eg: schemas)"
"Power BI",Workspaces,2,"This is one of, if not the worst course in the "Data Science Fundamentals" library. The audio quality is very low, it was hard to understand at multiple situations. The course itself doesn't cover fundamentals and feels very advanced at times. Most of the learnings steps are scattered and my overall impression is that it's disorganized. I expected more. "
"Power BI","First Data Model",2,"To have us a PDF file to follow step by step."
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",2,"For a beginner like myself. It wasn't easy to just comprehend those formulas. He didn't properly introduce or give us a reason why we will really need those formulas. Especially when we are tasked with a different scenario. My question is, i don't know if the formulas are the same approach for any task."
"Power BI","First Data Model",2,"Could be better"
"Power BI","Task Four, Part 3",1,"
These videos are not helping me out as they are been instructed in older version of PBI.

Please recreate the course with newer version of PBI"
"Power BI",Workspaces,1,"There was a lot of missing data, the order of the lectures need to be corrected, also improve the explanation of the steps on the video, is imposible to follow if there not a propper order and also update the videos to the recent version. This course was very confusing."

Probability,"Probability in Data Science",5,"very beginner friendly with many concrete examples. well done."
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",5,"Exceptional. I will redo it many times until I am fully confident of my understanding."
Probability,"Variations without Repetition",5,"This as well as the other courses I'm taking are just marvellous. I love the idea of having to answer questions after the explication of a major concept. This is an effort on the part of the 365 D.S team to ensure that I'm following along with the proper, requisite understanding for the next topics.
Also, I like how everything is not given to me during the lesson and I'm constantly being reminded to do my own research, check the python documentation etc, and create and solve my own problems. I think it's a great way to make me a proactive learner. 
I'm a final-year computer engineering student who's been taking the data analysis course for a month now and I can definitely envision my ignorance in data science on its way to Calvary to be crucified, thanks to the D.S 365 team. 
Thanks guys.Absolutely worth the go."

Probability,"Summary of Combinatorics",5,Great
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",4,"Thank you!"
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",4,"Maybe some more practical examples for 5 module?.. 
"
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",4,"A very good course with some good examples on distributions. But a little more depth would've been better."
Probability,"Summary of Combinatorics",4,"Too fast pace.
A similar video, such as "Summary of Combinatorics," should have been included between each portion of combinatorics to help students catch up and see the distinctions up to that point."
Probability,"Summary of Combinatorics",4,"really good. I knock off 1 star (should be 1/2 star) because the variations vs permutations definitions do not appear to be standard at least not in the UK. Variations in your terminology is what we call "permutations" so that is confusing."

Probability,"Probability in Data Science",3,"pdf with all formulas would be very helpfull"
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",3,"The theory is very well explained, but there are not enough course notes to really go back and study the concepts that have been taught. There should be more exhaustive course notes which are associated with each lesson"
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",3,"The course teaches concepts well.  However, it does not prepare you for the exams.  Additional study outside the materials is need.  Others have noted this as well in their reviews. "
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",3,"Course is great and really well presented, but there are not nearly enough examples or practice problems."
Probability,"Summary of Combinatorics",3,
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",3,"Sorry, maybe its just a basic course and the author tried his best, but the basic concepts are still unclear to me after finishing the course. "
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",3,"i know and understand each type of distribution, but still don't know how and when to use each of them in real life. "
Probability,"Summary of Combinatorics",3,"Pretty good but I think you should slow down. I dont understand what the hurry is. Also give more examples to solidify the concepts."
Probability,"Summary of Combinatorics",3,"Not very deep information and not many practice questions. 
Explaining with visuals is excellent. "
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",3,"In many videos used examples assuming the public has previous context knowledge as the cards examples. Both, the practical exercies and practical exams were significally more difficult than the examples explained. Many topics just touched."
Probability,"Probability in Data Science",1,"I would like to have explanations for quiz answers and more applicable questions. I had to learn from other materials even though I believe this course should fully prepare me. "

This course is just made for those who know Python and is just a quick recap 
Most of the topics covered didn't cover the basic topic understanding of the concept just move ahead 
Many practice solutions are soo bad like clueless about what is asked and what Instructor provides a solution (also for 2-3 line solutions almost 7-8 lines solutions are provided)
The pace of this Course is incredibly high which disappoints me the most

The instructor keeps on introducing soo many concepts in one single lecture and this continues till mid or maybe the end of the course "

SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",5,nice
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",5,"I like the lessons so far"
SQL,"The CASE Statement",5,"Been a great SQL course with lots of repetition. I'd say 99,999% of people won't learn by just watching the syntax. There was a real-ish relational database that was used throughout the course which gave the perfect opportunity to play around with the new concepts. I recommend people writing all the queries by hand themselves, it really solidifies the learnt concepts and prepares you better for exercises and practice exams."
SQL,"The CASE Statement",5,"that was good experience"
SQL,"Introduction to JOINs",5,"The best sql course ever "
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",5,"Beyond my expectations"
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",5,"very good lesson"

SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",5,"Excellent, exceeded my expectations!"
SQL,"The CASE Statement",5,"It's a good course, yet obviously it could be better. It's too robotic and methodical, there is a lot of theory that sometimes just doesn't stick to the brain. Some tasks are quite vague or is it just how sql tasks are build. "
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",5,"Excellent exceeded my expectations!"
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",5,"detailed and well presented"

SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,Goo
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"Interesting so far and the explanations are clear"
SQL,"Introduction to JOINs",4,"all necessary info but short lectures with assignments after each one really slows down learning tempo."
SQL,"Introduction to JOINs",4,"The information is layed out a little weird but its all very useful. 

The only thing that is a Con for this program is the slides, they are not concise and have a lot of duplicate information. I had to skip the majority of them because they just seem useless when there is so much irrelevant slides inbetween.

Other than that, the information is clear & the practice assignments inbetween lectures is very helpful."
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"Simple and clear lessons with practical implications"
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"The explanation is good...still looking for the practise I watch few courses"
SQL,"Introduction to JOINs",4,Amazing.
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"Great SQL..!"
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,good
SQL,"Introduction to JOINs",4,"Some videos could be more explaining. There could be some lecture pdfs containing snippets or photos of the statements and how to use them in real life code."
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"This course is really good"
SQL,"The CASE Statement",4,"It was really helpful and the way the instructor used is perfect. "
SQL,"Introduction to JOINs",4,"I like the course and I am definitely learning SQL. I just wish the assignments at the end were handled better. Downloading a zip, unzipping, and loading the code to "check" my code is cumbersome and (at least in my case) unnecessary. 

Either display a code I can copy and paste (perhaps make it initially hidden with a button to unhide) or, preferably, show me the expected output from SQL so I can check my output and troubleshoot before peeking at the code."
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"we need to have apportunity to practice instead of only theory "
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"Nice amazing course"
SQL,"The CASE Statement",4,"It's good but it's missing an important part of SQL statements: window functions"
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",4,"I would easily give 5 stars for the visual aspect, because it is a great course. But I cannot agree with "exceed my expectation", because it was only "to be able to learn the material  and understand its concepts", which has been achieved. However, its contents and its presentation exceeds quality in many ways as in comparison to other platforms and study methods I have came across so far. "

In general I enjoyed this course"
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",3,good
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",3,"course ok"
SQL,"Introduction to JOINs",3,"Please rework on slides:
1. It's looking very clutter. The background grey seems to dominate our eyes instead of blue color fonts
2. Please change the font. It looks heavy on the eyes."
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",3,"I would like to have more interactive material. Perhaps we are simply in the information stage of the lessons, and interacting will come later, but I don't learn well by listening to a narrated slide show presentation. I have to get into the information manually, try and often fail, until I get it right."
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",2,"the voice speed of the instructor is high, trying to reduce the video speed to .75 is giving bad results.
video scripts are not available, as a non-native speaker of English language, sometimes I need to read what the instructor said to make sure that I correctly understand what he is saying"
SQL,"Databases vs spreadsheets",1,"Same content as the Udemy course.
Nothing new.
I expected this to be more advanced/ improved."

I would rate 5 stars if there is continuous support to answer the students question from the Q&A section  "

Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",4,"Really nice. Only issue is that, in the short duration/time it is very difficult to do calculations by a non-statistics background learner."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",4,"I liked the small quizzes at the end of each lesson but they became less frequent in other sections as the material got harder. This course has a lot of information packed into fewer lessons, but there's less explanation on the actual equations. It would be nice if, since we're using excel, that there would be follow along demonstrations with the formulas used. I believe this course should be longer with follow along examples or even a second course to further explain. "

Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",4,"Some topics and exercises' explanations are not detailed enough, making them difficult to understand. What is evident for the teacher, is not that obvious for the beginners and often requires step-by-step explanation."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",4,"So far so good, would like random repetition to drive the drive some points home"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",4,"Easy to understand"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",4,"I was familiar with the topics, and I'm really into math, so this was not enough for me, but I understand that this course was made for newbies. And sometimes all these cartoon things are a bit annoying. "
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",4,"It is a very well structured course. However, I wish I had more practice exercises, as the course gets more difficult by the last section."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",4,"Thank you very much!"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,"It was good that the necessary steps that I had to do in Excel were explained."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,"Many of the videos could use a more thorough explanation of the topic discussed."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",3,"Best Course for Stastaaa"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",3,"Lots of lots of theoretical information with not much explanation on how useful it is in real world applications. Sorry but I expected some down to earth examples for solidifying the knowledge throughout the course."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",3,"will love to get more example on the real-world applications of each calculations not just the formulas."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,"it must explain slowly 
AND GIVE more details in each sections
pls give more examples about each concepts
i cannot create some visulaiztions you created it fast and you didn't tell me how i can create it 
"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",3,"need a little bit more explanation in a lot of concept"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,awesome
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",3,"Descriptive statistics was easy to understand as I had the topic somewhat learned in high school. However, later topics were harder and I wish they were explained in an easier language and with better examples.
Overall, I liked the course, but I feel it can be more beginner friendly."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,"Some videos don't explain how to do certain examples in excel. Ex. Histogram example video."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,"Hands-On is not available. I am not able to practice with any dataset. some issue is going on. Courses are pretty awesome and provide valuable knowledge. Example contains real-life case study which help a lot to understand the concept easily. "
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,"need more resourses "
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",3,"It's not very clear on a lot of things, simple things too, like how to create the charts you use and how the formulas are written. It's not impossible to complete the class or the assignments but you kinda need to look outside the class to do it. 

I haven't taken the test yet, but my guess is there's going to be questions on it that were either not covered or were covered too vaguely to be helpful. "
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",3,"I prefer more practical applications to practice each theory. Also, how the theories are applied in excel is not very clear. One page pdf summary would have made things clearer. 
It's my first time finding statistics so difficult to understand :("
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",3,"There are some errors in the videos, and you haven't answered various questions raised by the students in the Q&A section."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",2,"I expected a lot more from this section, considering that this is a paid course and I thought I'd get comprehensive information unlike the free videos but seems like free videos explain even better."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",2,"I feel like this course assumed some knowledge of statistics. Nothing was explained in depth and I had to use alot of outside resources to understand course material and I still dont feel like I fully understand. There was also several time that regression analysis was said to be taught but its never actually taught in this course. Also there are a few issues where the downloaded excel file was not the same as the file being used in the lesson such as during the practical example at the end, the teacher used sample variance in the course and in the file we are shown population variance which just makes everything more confusing. If I am going to pay for courses I should not have to use free outside sources to learn the material. "
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",2,"Harder stuff was overlooked. There is no summarized pdf or document that can be utilized as a reference while solving problems."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Descriptive Statistics",2,"The examples could be better"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",2,"Overall, a good course. 

Given I didn't know what to expect, and a complete newbie to this, I felt this would be a good investment. While in some respects it has been, I did find it wasn't entirely beginner friendly. Some concepts were not properly explained, while some were glossed over(i.e null hypothesis). Given what I've had to learn in other places, I just felt it wasn't done well here. Sometimes it made me question myself when in fact it wasn't entirely my fault. 

I was very dissatisfied with its delivery as I could tell the author of the course wasn't thinking about his/her audience. If the author indeed was then the course clearly isn't for me; I am not confident recommending it to friends as their money will be best spent elsewhere as total newbies. It has led me to approach other courses in the career track with a bit of apprehension, thus forcing me to supplement them with other resources elsewhere on the internet. 

I hope this gets revised in the future as there is indeed some potential. The graphics really do help visually but depth, clarity and simplicity in content delivery is just as important. 

Thanks."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",2,"It is difficult, not clear, carton videos is not useful for the explanation, the last example was good but not complete. the instructor assumed that the student understand some topics"
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",2,"The Hypothesis testing is poorly covered in this course. Instead of animation, the concept should be described on white board (manually) "
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",1,"need more explanation for the MS excel formulas that he used in the course especially the ones for long steps."
Statistics,"Practical Example - Hypothesis Testing",1,"I Considering that most of the courses are 4.8 out of 5 and in my opinion do not reflect the true quality of the courses, I am starting to suspect that the course ratings are not correct. Especially, after taking several courses, I see a huge gap between the quality of different courses."

"The Machine Learning Process A-Z",Conclusion,5,"The course was informative. As someone who went through a Data Science bootcamp, I still was able to leave this course learning new techniques. The course could use some cleaning up with the order and the notebooks (which I'm not sure was updated since I started, stopped and pick back up the course a few weeks later) but I adjusted accordingly. They appropriate chose the level in which to jump into this course as it is not necessarily for beginners. I'd rate it a 5/5. I look forward to more courses from Jeff and Ken in the future. "

"The Machine Learning Process A-Z",Conclusion,5,"This course literarily saves me dozens of hours of time from watching various YouTube videos and looking up codes on the Internet. You‚Äôd find this course useful whether you‚Äôre doing your first portfolio project, or you‚Äôre a working professional. 

The companion notebooks and GitHub repo are golden! In the past, it took me dozens of hours to google the exact same thing on specific codes. Jeff and Ken did most of the heavy lifting for you, so that you can focus on working on your projects. 

Most importantly, Jeff has worked in well-known and reputable companies. So you know that his content and material are trustworthy. Though there‚Äôre a lot of ‚ÄúKaggle Champions‚Äù on YouTube giving a walk-through on an ML project, I value that Jeff and Ken‚Äôs teaching a lot because of his years of experience in major tech companies.

This course stands out to me because it talks about the end-to-end process of building ML models. 
This is a topic that even some bootcamps don‚Äôt talk about it a lot. They either don‚Äôt spend much time to talk about it thoroughly, or they gloss over it, or they assume that ‚Äúyou would figure it out‚Äù along the way. 
So this course solves that problem to give you a walk through on that process. 

You would notice that each lecture video‚Äôs length is about several minute long to keep it bite-sized. 
And the coding notebook walkthrough videos are also thorough to cover the lecture video‚Äôs portions. 
So you‚Äôll get both the theoretical knowledge and practical experience in this case. 

After watching this course, you should be able to do a Machine Learning project from start to finish, end-to-end all by yourself. 

I look forward to the Part 2 of the course ‚Äì Machine Learning Algorithms with Jeff Li and Ken Jee."
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","ML for Data products",5,"Chapter 2, clear and straightforward explaination so far, precious material "
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","ML for Data products",5,Excellent
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","ML for Data products",5,"Very nice and clear conceptualization."
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z",Conclusion,5,"The course was very informative although it very much reminded me of classes where the professor would just read their power points to the class. This course could be greatly improved with more case study examples demonstrating the specifics using comparative real world examples. Additionally removing some of the redundancy  where code videos say the same things as the lecture videos even using the same examples in some cases."

"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","Embedded methods",4,"The coding examples and coding portion ideally should come after the theory lectures."
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z",Conclusion,4,"Great course!! Thanks for all your time and efforts. I enjoyed and learned a lot. I would wish course had a lecture notes in PDF format as a quick reminder brochure. "
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z",Conclusion,4,"It was quite interesting.  There are a few bugs but the material is well thought through and explained well"
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z",Conclusion,4,"A pretty good course to fill the blank spots in your knowledge. Has a few issues like content ordering and bugs in the code, but it's not too critical"
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","Embedded methods",3,"I can't say following this course is smooth. Resources vary, in GitHub, Collab and videos. Coding section doesn't add much more background. It's hard to understand the usage of all of the techniques."
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","Embedded methods",3,"I don't know which rate should I do
but  I think this is an advanced course that tries to teach you the theory principles of ML, it is a wrong starter course in ML.
-----------------------------------------
Also, the order of lessons in sections needs to adjust.  "
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","Embedded methods",3,"No PDF course note and some important concepts were not explaiend in detailed as they should be "
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z","Embedded methods",3,"I prefer to practice more, rather theories only. "
"The Machine Learning Process A-Z",Conclusion,2,"I wanted to provide feedback on the course I recently completed. Overall, I found the course to be good and informative, but I had difficulties completing it due to my lack of understanding of the material. I found that Jeffrey Li's teaching style was not effective for me as he moved quickly through the coding portion without providing sufficient explanation. On the other hand, I appreciated Ken Jee's teaching style as his explanations were clear and helped me gain a full understanding of the material. I believe that Jeffrey may be a better instructor for others, but for my learning style, Ken was the more effective teacher.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback and I hope that this information can be used to improve the course for future students."
